Keystone is a minimalist book publishing template that helps authors not only get to the finish line faster, but think more clearly about structure, tooling, and ownership.

It gives you a reproducible build system, clean separation of layout and content, and a dev-friendly workflow with just enough automation to stay out of your way.

Built with [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

You're holding the very first page of a book built with Keystone. Welcome aboard.
