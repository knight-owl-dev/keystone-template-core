# The Journey Begins

Every project has a story. This one begins not with a book, but with a problem.

## The Friction We Felt

Somewhere between the outline and the output, between raw ideas and polished pages, we realized that publishing — for developers — felt... wrong.

Writing was manageable. Structuring was fine. But **publishing**? That was a patchwork of copy-pasting, PDF settings, rogue formatting, and mysterious style files.

It wasn’t joyful. It wasn’t versioned. It wasn’t reproducible.

So we asked ourselves: what would it look like to build books like we build software?

## A Line in the Sand

We began with a small goal: **can we write a book in Markdown and build it like code?**

- With structure
- With control
- With respect for the writer's intent
- And with just enough automation to help — not interfere

The first Makefile was humble. The first PDF was... fine.

But it worked. And that was enough to keep going.

## Enter the Keystone

We called this scaffold **Keystone** — the central piece in an arch, the one that holds everything together.

It's not a platform. It’s a philosophy:

- **Structure matters.**
- **Authorship is ownership.**
- **Tooling should support you, not surprise you.**

Everything in Keystone is discoverable, editable, and version-controlled. From the layout to the metadata, you are in command.

No black boxes. No wizard-driven magic.

Just Markdown, Make, and a beautifully transparent build.

## Looking to the Hourglass

Keystone didn’t emerge in a vacuum.

It’s one stepping stone in a longer journey — a broader initiative called **Hourglass** — an effort to rethink how knowledge is shaped, structured, and shared. But that's a story for another book.

Still, you may notice echoes of it here: clarity of purpose, clean boundaries, and timeless simplicity.

## Where You're Standing

If you’re reading this, you’ve already taken the first step.

This chapter — this book — is a working example of what Keystone makes possible. It exists to inspire you, guide you, or just give you something to modify and make your own.

You can build from here. Or you can delete it all and start fresh.

Either way, the pipeline is yours now.

Welcome to the journey.
